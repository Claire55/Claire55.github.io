It's hard to start over in life.  It's difficult to start a new job but it's even more difficult to start a new career.  You already spend all this money saying, "This is worth my investment.  This is what I want to do for the rest of my life."  You put in all that time, blood (literally blood, job hazzards and all that), sweat and tears... and then something happens... and you can no longer do that thing.  The thing you were best at, the thing you loved most in this world, is no longer possible.  The dream you once had for yourself is gone.  Giving your notice at your current job you cried because of how unfair life seemed at the time. 

So, what do you do?  For me personally, I just let myself sit in my sadness for a while.  I didn't want to do anything.  I didn't want to admit that my dream was over so soon.  But at some point I took a good hard look at myself and what I was doing.  And, I realized that this look wasn't good for me.  This wasn't what I wanted for myself.  I looked like the epitome of self pity.  So, I decided that I would just have to find a new dream.  But what could that be.  What else in the world did I truly love?  When did I feel the most like myself?  

Growing up, my father did all sorts of different jobs in the IT field.  So as a child, I got to see all sorts of technology and learn about it.  Technology has always been a huge part of my life.  Then, one day I read an article about a man who was single handedly creating a high end video game.  When I saw the test trailer I was blown away.  Now the game has more developers, it has recieved funding from a few big name corporations, but it all started with just one man.  One man with a dream and a vision.  I want to be like that man.  I want to use technology to create and design.  I decided to start in software development, but ultimately I would like to learn the coding languages used to create video games.  My endgame is to create something great; something that I can be proud of.  Most of all, I want to make something that can create change and make a difference in the world.
