So, this is my second start to coding bootcamp after switching to self paced.  At first my two jobs were interfering too much with keeping pace and now the world is in chaos and it's still not any easier.   You would think that having to stay home all the time would make it easier to do online courses but you would be wrong.  It just makes it that much harder to pay your bills.  However, I am determined; soccer practice is over and it is time to pick it up (joke courtesy of Tina Fey).  After creating a daily schedule I am finally back on track.  

After starting to self paced, I did not expect the order in which the curriculum was taught to change.  Not that it was a problem, but I had to double take to make sure I hadn't accidentally changed courses by accident.  I must admit, learning the functions of Git is not as fasinating to me as learning a dynamic coding language.  Although, I do see how important a role knowing these functions will have in the future and furthuring one's career.  And it will be a good review to go through what I had already been learning once I reach that point, yet again.  They say that IT jobs will be big in the future.  I just have to make it though this part of life first.  Hopefully the world will start to get back to normal soon and we will all get throught the coronavirus madness.
